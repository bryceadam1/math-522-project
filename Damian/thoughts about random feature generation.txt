Random Feature generation

I look at classifiers that depend on several features.

I assume each feature's mean is a function of the output, plus some random noise.

I assume that what these functions look like follow some sort of random distribution.

We hope that this will lead to insights as to what kind of situations makes things work well.



I am using this on made up data where all the features are about equally useful.
Increasing the number of parameters does not tend to lead to improvements when there is a one layer linear regression, and all the features are equally important.
